# zipserver
a basic FTP server which shows .zip, .rar and .7z files as folders, allowing you to browse them without first having to download the archive.
the server is read-only, so there's no renaming or uploading or anything like that.
login hasn't been implemented, so any username + password combo will be seen as valid.
there's also plenty of exploits lurking here and there, which I might or might not patch up later.
